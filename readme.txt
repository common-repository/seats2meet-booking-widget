= What is Seats2meet.com? =
Seats2meet.com provides an easy booking platform where users can book Workspaces, Meetingspaces or request a Deskspace. A booking is made in four easy steps. By entering the requested city or region, the date and time, you get the ‘best-match’ selection of S2M locations. After choosing your location you can add options to enhance the meeting itself, like equipment and/or food & beverage services and move on to the third step. Here you see a summery of your booking (the Cart) and you can enter your personal details, including ‘contract rates’ and/or ‘discount rates’. Last but not least you can do an online payment or move on without paying and receive an invoice. All booking details are accessible via the Booking overview in your personal menu. Of course you can change your booking 24/7.
